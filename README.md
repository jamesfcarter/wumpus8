Hunt the Wumpus for the PDP-8
-----------------------------

[Hunt the Wumpus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_The_Wumpus) is a classic
computer game, written in BASIC by Gregory Yob in 1972. This port is for the
[PDP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8), a machine that actually predates
the game by a number of years. I've tried to keep this game as close as
possible to the original (although I have corrected a few of Gregory's typos).

This game is written in PDP-8 assembley language and is suitable for the
PALBART assembler. If you don't have a PDP-8 to hand, you could use the SIMH
simulator.
